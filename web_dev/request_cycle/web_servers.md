# What are some key design philosophies of Linux?
Keep your programs short with a small scope of command- one thing per program. Choose portability over efficiency and use shell scripts to increase portability. Use software leverage- borrow good code, don't reinvent.

# What is a VPS?
A virtual private service is a virtual machine that can run its own operating system on a public server. They are cheaper, but might also be slower, than a physical server.
