# Data Structures

1. Data structures are useful to programmers for storing large amounts of information. 

# Arrays 
2. An array is an ordered list of characters (can be strings, integers, or booleans) that is indexed from 0 up. 
3. An array might be good for listing books that someone has or food items in a refrigerator. 

#Hashes 
4. A hash is an ordered series of information that groups its components into two sections: keys and values. 
5. A hash might be well suited to connect a username and password or to put things into sections 

#Iteration 
6. Iteration is useful because it allows you to go through each section. 
7. If you wanted to find your keys you would have to look under each of the pillows on your couch. 

#Blocks
8. A block is an object, so a section of independent, functional code. 
9. Parameters are what you pass through the code, but the whole block can also be yielded or blocked.
